# science_fiction_LLM


## Introduction

Using science fiction to reconceptualize AI and superintelligence using Large-Language Models (LLMs).

## Installation

```R
pip install -r requirements.txt


mkdir -p /home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/google/colab

```

Add a new file called `.env` and type in the following:

```R
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<yourapikeywhichisprivate>"
```

Create a `.gitignore` file and add the following

.env

You can then execute the following notebooks in Github codespaces or Google Colab.

`papers` folder has documents for RAG

`.jinja` files have system prompts for querying the LLM

`.txt` files have logs for the output of LLMs
